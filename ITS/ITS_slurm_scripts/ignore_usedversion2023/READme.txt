The folder named 'ignore_usedversion2023' was my files associated with my first attempt on the
resequenced ITS data. I have to reprocess because I used qiime2 version 2023 instead of 2021 which is NEEDED
for the unite classifier. All artifacts were created with version 2023, but the classifier is version 2021 and 
needs files associated with that version.
