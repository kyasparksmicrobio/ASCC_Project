Usage: qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

  Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
  phylogenetic) to a feature table.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table containing the samples over which
                          diversity metrics should be computed.     [required]
  --i-phylogeny ARTIFACT  Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that
    Phylogeny[Rooted]     correspond to the feature identifiers in the table.
                          This tree can contain tip ids that are not present
                          in the table, but all feature ids in the table must
                          be present in this tree.                  [required]
Parameters:
  --p-sampling-depth INTEGER
    Range(1, None)        The total frequency that each sample should be
                          rarefied to prior to computing diversity metrics.
                                                                    [required]
  --m-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple arguments   The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
     will be merged)                                                [required]
  --p-n-jobs-or-threads VALUE Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto')
                          [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only] - The number
                          of concurrent jobs or CPU threads to use in
                          performing this calculation. Individual methods will
                          create jobs/threads as implemented in
                          q2-diversity-lib dependencies. May not exceed the
                          number of available physical cores. If
                          n-jobs-or-threads = 'auto', one thread/job will be
                          created for each identified CPU core on the host.
                                                                  [default: 1]

                    There was a problem with the command:                     
 (1/1) Invalid value for '--i-table': Expected an artifact of at least type
  FeatureTable[Frequency]. An artifact of type FeatureData[Taxonomy] was
  provided.
