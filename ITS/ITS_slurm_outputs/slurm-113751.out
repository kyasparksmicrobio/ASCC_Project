Usage: qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic [OPTIONS]

  Applies a collection of diversity metrics (both phylogenetic and non-
  phylogenetic) to a feature table.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The feature table containing the samples over which
                          diversity metrics should be computed.     [required]
  --i-phylogeny ARTIFACT  Phylogenetic tree containing tip identifiers that
    Phylogeny[Rooted]     correspond to the feature identifiers in the table.
                          This tree can contain tip ids that are not present
                          in the table, but all feature ids in the table must
                          be present in this tree.                  [required]
Parameters:
  --p-sampling-depth INTEGER
    Range(1, None)        The total frequency that each sample should be
                          rarefied to prior to computing diversity metrics.
                                                                    [required]
  --m-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple arguments   The sample metadata to use in the emperor plots.
     will be merged)                                                [required]
  --p-with-replacement / --p-no-with-replacement
                          Rarefy with replacement by sampling from the
                          multinomial distribution instead of rarefying
                          without replacement.                [default: False]
  --p-n-jobs-or-threads VALUE Int % Range(1, None) | Str % Choices('auto')
                          [beta/beta-phylogenetic methods only] - The number
                          of concurrent jobs or CPU threads to use in
                          performing this calculation. Individual methods will
                          create jobs/threads as implemented in
                          q2-diversity-lib dependencies. May not exceed the
                          number of available physical cores. If
                          n-jobs-or-threads = 'auto', one thread/job will be
                          created for each identified CPU core on the host.
                                                                  [default: 1]

Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                          during execution of this action. Or silence output
                          if execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --recycle-pool TEXT     Use a cache pool for pipeline resumption. QIIME 2
                          will cache your results in this pool for reuse by
                          future invocations. These pool are retained until
                          deleted by the user. If not provided, QIIME 2 will
                          create a pool which is automatically reused by
                          invocations of the same action and removed if the
                          action is successful. Note: these pools are local to
                          the cache you are using.
  --no-recycle            Do not recycle results from a previous failed
                          pipeline run or save the results from this run for
                          future recycling.
  --parallel              Execute your action in parallel. This flag will use
                          your default parallel config.
  --parallel-config FILE  Execute your action in parallel using a config at
                          the indicated path.
  --use-cache DIRECTORY   Specify the cache to be used for the intermediate
                          work of this pipeline. If not provided, the default
                          cache under $TMP/qiime2/<uname> will be used.
                          IMPORTANT FOR HPC USERS: If you are on an HPC system
                          and are using parallel execution it is important to
                          set this to a location that is globally accessible
                          to all nodes in the cluster.
  --example-data PATH     Write example data and exit.
  --citations             Show citations and exit.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
