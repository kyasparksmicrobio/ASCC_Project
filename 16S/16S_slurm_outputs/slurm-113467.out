There was an issue with loading the file /home/projects-wilkins-2/ASCC/summer_2024/16S/16S_metadata/ASCC_16S_barcodes.txt as metadata:

  Metadata file path doesn't exist, or the path points to something other than a file. Please check that the path exists, has read permissions, and points to a regular file (not a directory): /home/projects-wilkins-2/ASCC/summer_2024/16S/16S_metadata/ASCC_16S_barcodes.txt

  There may be more errors present in the metadata file. To get a full report, sample/feature metadata files can be validated with Keemei: https://keemei.qiime2.org
