"This is soil chemistry data obtained from Tim Fegel (Rocky Mountain Research Station), obtained October 2024"	
- missing some data for particular sites in 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm as of 10/2024	
    - water extractable chem isnâ€™t quite done (they need to rerun some at dilution for high Mg and Ca concentrations).	
    - NH4-N (mg/L)	-> missing for a portion of San Juan 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm samples 
        -   ASCC 228 - ASCC 269	
    - NO3-N(mg/L) ->   missing for a portion of San Juan 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm samples 	
        - ASCC 228 - ASCC 269
