# ASCC Project: Soil Microbiome Analysis

This repository contains data processing, analysis scripts, and results for the **Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC)** soil microbiome study. The project includes 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon data, soil chemical metadata, and code used for bioinformatics and statistical analysis.

## Summary

This project examines bacterial and fungal community responses across different depths and sites in forest soils under climate-adapted silvicultural treatments. It includes:

- **16S**: bacterial/archaeal community profiling  
- **ITS**: fungal community profiling  
- **MAGs**: metagenome-assembled genomes & DRAM annotation  
- **Soil chemistry**: pH, nutrients, and other abiotic drivers

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyasparksmicrobio/ASCC_Project.git
cd ASCC_Project
```

### 2. Install Git LFS (for large file support)

```bash
brew install git-lfs   # macOS
git lfs install
```

## Data Notes

- Large files (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.tsv`) are tracked with **Git LFS**.
- Intermediate `.qza`, `.fastq`, and `.pptx` files are excluded via `.gitignore`.
- Sensitive raw sequencing data is stored on [external drive/cluster path].

## Git LFS Warnings

GitHub may warn about large files (>50MB), but these are safely managed with Git LFS. If you clone this repo, make sure you run:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```
