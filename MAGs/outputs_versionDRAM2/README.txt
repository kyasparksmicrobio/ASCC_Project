I majorly screwed up the first time around processing this data (February-May)
I completely restarted from scratch and and resent the samples out on 7/8/24
original samples were messed up because the blanks for 16S had 
high reads, while the ITS had low reads.
Poor organization and contamination was the cause of all of this.

I was extremely caredful when doing it the second time around.
